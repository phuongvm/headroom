//! SQLite-backed CCR store.
//!
//! The default **production** backend: persistent across worker
//! restarts and shareable across workers via a shared DB file. Schema:
//!
//! ```sql
//! CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ccr_entries (
//!     hash          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
//!     original      BLOB NOT NULL,
//!     created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- unix-seconds
//!     ttl_seconds   INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- idle window, restarted on get
//!     last_accessed INTEGER NOT NULL    -- unix-seconds
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! The TTL is an **idle window** (#2604): every successful `get`
//! restarts the row's clock via `last_accessed`, bounded by an absolute
//! max lifetime measured from `created_at`. On every `get` we
//! lazy-purge stale rows (`WHERE last_accessed + ttl_seconds <= now OR
//! created_at + max_lifetime <= now`) — no background reaper thread,
//! no cron. DBs created by pre-sliding builds are migrated in place
//! (the `last_accessed` column is added, backfilled from `created_at`).
//!
//! All hot statements are prepared once on connection setup and reused
//! per call (per realignment build constraint #5: performant). Writes
//! upsert by primary key so re-storing the same hash overwrites in
//! place (matches in-memory and Redis backend semantics).
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! `rusqlite::Connection` is `!Sync`, so we wrap it in a `Mutex`. CCR
//! reads/writes are short and rare relative to the proxy hot path, so
//! a single mutex on the connection is fine. Operators who measure
//! contention can shard by spinning up N stores backed by N DB files
//! (e.g. one per worker) — multi-worker safety is provided by SQLite's
//! own file locking.
//!
//! # WAL mode
//!
//! We open the connection in WAL mode so reads do not block writes
//! (and vice versa), and the on-disk journal does not grow unbounded.
//! Critical for proxy workloads where many concurrent retrievals can
//! land while a compression flushes a fresh row.
