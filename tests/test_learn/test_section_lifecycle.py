"""Removal invariant for merged sections — the deletion half of #2293.

``test_writer.py`` covers preservation inside a section that the new run
re-emits. The cases here cover the other transition: a section the new run
does not emit at all, which never reaches the same-section merge and so has
to be pruned on the writer's carry-forward path instead. Without that, the
last item of a category can expire and its heading still be pinned in the
file forever.

The learner-level test lives here rather than in ``test_traffic_learner.py``
because it asserts on writer behaviour; it drives the real, unmodified
``_patterns_to_recommendations`` to get there.
