"""A-2: ``HEADROOM_OFFLINE=1`` must actually stop outbound connections.

The switch was documented as an air-gap guarantee but several egress paths
never consulted it, so a customer who set it and believed they were air-gapped
was wrong. These tests pin the guarantee down in two complementary ways:

* **Per-path socket tests.** Each previously-unguarded path is exercised with
  ``socket.socket.connect`` / ``socket.create_connection`` booby-trapped, so
  the test fails if a single connection is attempted. Asserting "no socket"
  rather than "raises" matters: a guard placed after the client is constructed
  would still pass a raises-check while leaking a connection.

* **A meta-test.** The per-path tests only cover the paths we already know
  about, and the whole point of a chokepoint is that path number four cannot
  forget it. ``test_every_egress_site_is_guarded_or_allowlisted`` enumerates
  the outbound clients in ``headroom/`` and requires each **site** either to
  have a ``guard_egress`` call that dominates it or to be counted in the
  allowlist with a written reason. Per site, not per file: a file-wide
  "contains the string guard_egress" check — the first version of this test —
  exempts a module because of a word in its docstring, and makes the
  allowlist's site counts unreachable for every file that guards anything.
  ``TestSiteScannerRules`` pins each of those bypasses.

* **The same sweep over ``crates/``.** ``TestRustEgressChokepointCoverage``
  applies a text-level version of the rule to the Rust sources. ``crates/``
  was outside the Python scan entirely, which is how the Kompress model and
  fastembed weight downloads stayed open in the same change that guarded the
  Rust tokenizer fetch for precisely the reason that applied to all three.

The runtime behaviour of the Rust switch (``crates/headroom-core/src/
offline.rs``) is tested by ``cargo test -p headroom-core``; what lives here is
the cross-language parity assertion, because the two implementations silently
drifting apart is the failure mode a Python-only test suite cannot see.

# The per-path tests above only cover the paths we already know about. This
# half is the standing guarantee: a NEW egress path cannot land without either
# calling the guard or being written into the allowlist with a reason.
#
# It decides per **egress site**, not per file. The first cut of this test
# skipped any file whose text contained "guard_egress" anywhere — including in
# a docstring — which made every allowlist count unreachable for guarded files
# and let a second, unguarded client slip into an already-guarded module. The
# scan is therefore built on the AST (so comments and docstrings cannot vouch
# for anything) and a site counts as guarded only when a guard_egress call
# DOMINATES it: same block or an enclosing block, textually earlier, in the
# same function. A guard in a sibling branch, in a nested function, or in an
# except: arm the site does not sit in is not a guard for that site.

# Every file below has at least one egress site that does NOT call

#
#   loopback          talks only to 127.0.0.1 / the operator's own local proxy.
#                     It never leaves the box, so the air-gap switch has
#                     nothing to protect.
#   gated             an is_offline() check upstream makes this code
#                     unreachable, so the connection is never built. Routing it
#                     through guard_egress as well would be redundant.
#   user-traffic      the caller's own request being forwarded to the upstream
#                     the operator configured — the proxy's actual job, and
#                     the reason an air-gapped deployment runs one at all.
#   operator-endpoint Headroom dialling an address that comes entirely from
#                     operator configuration and defaults to loopback. Exactly
#                     one thing qualifies today (the Ollama embedder). A
#                     hard-coded internet host may never hide behind this.
#   cache-only        the call provably cannot reach the network because the
#                     surrounding code forces the HuggingFace stack offline for
#                     its duration; the network fallback beside it IS guarded.
#
# There is deliberately NO "known violation" category. The first version of
# this allowlist had one — `unguarded`, "out of scope for A-2" — and it held
# nine files including Copilot auth, three subscription pollers, the release
# binary and codebase-memory-mcp downloads, the eval dataset fetch and both
# Headroom Cloud compression integrations. Recording that a switch does not do
# what it says is not the same as making it do it, and an allowlist that can
# absorb a violation stops being a list of exceptions and becomes a list of
# bugs nobody has to fix. Those nine are now guarded; the category is gone;
# `test_no_category_permits_a_known_violation` keeps it gone.
#
# Value is (number of UNGUARDED egress sites in the file, reason). Guarded
# sites are not counted and do not need an entry, so a file can legitimately
# appear here and still route some of its egress through the chokepoint. The
# count is part of the assertion: adding a second unguarded client to a listed
# file trips this test, and so does adding one to a file that is fully guarded
# today — that file simply has no entry, so the new site is unallowlisted.
# The complete set of reasons an egress site may skip the guard. Pinned by
# `test_no_category_permits_a_known_violation`; see the comment above.

# in each crate's own `#[test]`s.
