"""A successful upstream turn must never become a synthesized error (#3088).

The buffered CCR path flips a streaming turn to ``stream: false`` so retrieval
can be resolved server-side. Everything it does *after* the provider answers —
retrieval, memory tool calls, turn hooks, usage accounting, caching, SSE
resynthesis — is post-processing layered on a turn that already succeeded and
was already billed.

When one of those steps raised, the whole turn surfaced to the client as:

    event: error
    data: {"type":"error","error":{"type":"api_error", ...}}

In the reported capture the provider had returned a complete 69,351-byte answer
in 1.9s; the client received 1,841 bytes of keepalives and that error. The
answer was paid for and thrown away, and no traceback was logged, so the real
defect stayed invisible.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix: relay the upstream's own answer
rather than inventing a failure, and refuse to relay a response the client
cannot safely consume.
