"""Tool-schema deferral must not read as a near-total saving in /stats.

Deferral withholds the same schemas on every turn, so its token count grows
with the session while the tokens it removed would, after the first turn, have
been prefix-cache reads. Two things therefore have to hold:

* the token percentage divides by every input token the provider billed, cached
  prefix included — a gateway turn that reports only its uncached remainder as
  input made this read ~97% on real Claude Code traffic;
* the same saving is published in money as well, priced at cache rates, because
  the token share and the cost share are not the same number.
