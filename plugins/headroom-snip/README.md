# headroom-snip

A Claude Code mod that shows what Headroom does to each request, live. When a
request goes through the proxy, a pair of scissors runs along a bar the size of
the original prompt, cuts it down to what was actually sent, and the token
count drops as it goes:

```
✂ headroom 21k → 16k   tok ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━✂⡀⠄⠂⠁⢀⠈⠐⠠ −81%
✂ headroom 21k → 7.6k  tok ━━━━━━━━━━━✂⠈⠐⠠⡀⠄⠂⠁⢀⠈⠐⠠⡀⠄⠂······ −81%
✂ headroom 21k → 4.1k  tok ━━━━━━·························· −81%
  JSON crush ×2 · Kompress text · cache align   project 184k saved (62%) over 23 req ≈ 307 pages  details  hide
```

## What it shows

- **The band above the prompt.** The latest request: original → sent tokens,
  the snip animation, and the percentage cut. Below that, which compressors did
  the cutting (`JSON crush`, `code AST`, `Kompress text`, `log squash`,
  `cache align`, ...) and the running total since the session started. A request sent unchanged says why,
  for example `kept: user message, recent code` or `nothing worth a snip`.
- **`/headroom`.** Opens a pane with the requests since the session started: one bar per
  request, what was cut and what was protected, how long compression took, the
  biggest snip so far, and an all-time total.
  `/headroom hide` and `/headroom show` toggle the band.
- **The status line.** `✂ 184k tok saved · 62%`.
- **Milestone toasts** at 10k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1M and 5M tokens saved.
- **No proxy?** If nothing answers, the band says so and suggests
  `headroom wrap claude`.

## How it works

While a turn runs, the mod polls the proxy's loopback `GET /stats?cached=1`
once a second. It reads the `recent_requests` tail (per-request token counts
and `transforms_applied`), and keeps polling for a few seconds after the turn
ends. Requests stamped before the session started count as history: they
aren't animated or added to the totals, even if the proxy only comes up later.
Nothing leaves your machine.

The proxy can't tell Claude Code sessions apart, so the totals are never
per session. What they cover depends on how Claude Code reaches the proxy:

- **Through `headroom wrap claude`:** each request carries an
  `X-Headroom-Project` header naming the launch directory (its basename, so
  two directories with the same name share a tag). The mod counts every
  request with this session's tag, including other sessions in the same
  project, and leaves other projects out. The proxy only reports tags for its
  last ten requests, so a request it can't attribute is left out rather than
  guessed. The band says "project" and `/headroom` names the project.
- **Any other way:** there is no tag, so the totals cover every client on the
  proxy since this session started. The band says "proxy" and `/headroom` says
  so.

It finds the proxy in this order:

1. `HEADROOM_PROXY_URL`
2. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (as `headroom wrap claude` sets it)
3. `http://127.0.0.1:8787`

Only loopback URLs are used: `http` or `https` on exactly `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
or `[::1]`, with no user or password. A value that isn't one (a remote proxy, or a
host like `localhost.example.com`) is skipped, so the mod never polls a remote host.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add headroomlabs-ai/headroom
claude plugin install headroom-snip@headroom-marketplace
```

Or, from a checkout: `claude --plugin-dir plugins/headroom-snip`.

## Develop

```bash
claude plugin validate plugins/headroom-snip
claude plugin test plugins/headroom-snip      # tests/snip.test.tsx
tsc -p plugins/headroom-snip                  # after Claude Code has loaded it once
```

`hooks/snip.ts` holds the pure parts (parsing, transform labels, the animation
frames) and `hooks/register.tsx` holds the hooks and drawing.
