"""The provider's own billed input-token count, from its own usage block.

Every volume and cost figure Headroom reports ("input after Headroom", the
licence usage report, the dashboard's per-model table) should be the number
the provider billed, not Headroom's local tokenizer estimate. Headroom counts
Claude with ``o200k_base`` as a stand-in for a private tokenizer; on real
Claude Code transcripts that runs 15-25% under Claude 4.x and 35-38% under
Claude 5.x, and it never sees the system prompt or tool definitions at all.

The providers disagree about what their headline input field means, which is
why this lives in one place:

* Anthropic (and Bedrock/Vertex, which forward Anthropic-shape usage):
  ``usage.input_tokens`` is only the tokens AFTER the last cache breakpoint.
  Cache reads and writes are separate, disjoint buckets, so the billed total
  is ``input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens``.
  The Anthropic Console reports the same three columns.
* OpenAI (chat ``prompt_tokens``, Responses ``input_tokens``): inclusive.
  ``*_tokens_details.cached_tokens`` is a SUBSET of the headline figure.
* Gemini: ``promptTokenCount`` is inclusive; ``cachedContentTokenCount`` is a
  subset of it.

A return of 0 means "the provider reported nothing", never "zero tokens":
callers fall back to the local estimate and the request is counted as
estimated rather than provider-reported (see ``RequestOutcome``).
