"""Context-limit guard: keep client auto-compaction working under compression.

Compression makes the usage reported back to the client reflect the
*forwarded* (compressed) request, not the client's raw transcript. Clients
whose auto-compaction keys off reported usage (Claude Code) therefore defer
compaction — the selling point — but with no floor: the raw transcript can
grow until even the compressed request exceeds the model's real context
window. From that point every turn fails with a 400 ``prompt is too long``,
the client force-compacts on each error, and the session degrades into a
compact-every-other-prompt loop (field report 2026-08-12).

Three cooperating pieces, all passthrough until the danger zone:

1. ``effective_context_limit`` — the window the forwarded request is really
   subject to: the model's registry limit, raised to 1M when the client sent
   a ``context-1m`` beta token, capped by any limit *learned* from an actual
   ``prompt is too long`` error (piece 2). Also used for compression
   pressure, so 1M sessions stop being treated as 5x over budget.
2. ``note_prompt_too_long`` — parses ``prompt is too long: N tokens > M
   maximum`` from upstream 400 bodies and records M per (model, 1m-beta)
   key. This is how a client that *believes* 1M but whose account is capped
   at 200k stops looping after exactly one error.
3. ``StreamUsageGuard`` — an SSE transformer for the streamed bytes only:
   when the ``message_start`` usage total reaches ``TRIGGER_FRACTION`` of
   the effective limit, it inflates the reported ``input_tokens`` — in both
   ``message_start`` and the final cumulative-usage ``message_delta``, which
   clients merge over the former — so the client's gauge reads
   ``REPORT_FRACTION`` of the window the client believes in, which trips
   the client's own graceful compaction before the 400 wall. Savings
   metrics and telemetry parse the original upstream bytes, never the
   nudged ones.

The nudged number is deliberately unmarked on the wire. It exists to be read
by the client's own compaction gauge, which is a third-party parser we do not
control, so anything added beside it is either ignored or a wire-shape change
against a client we cannot test. Nothing inside headroom needs the marker:
savings, telemetry and billing all read the original upstream bytes, never the
client-bound ones, and each rewrite emits ``event=context_guard_nudge`` with
the forwarded and reported totals for reconciliation.

Kill switch: ``HEADROOM_CONTEXT_GUARD=0``.
