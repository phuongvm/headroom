"""Tool-schema savings attribution policy for proxy stats.

Headroom saves input tokens in two accounting shapes, and the split is not a
style choice — it follows from what each transform can observe:

* **Compaction** (``*:tool_schema_compaction``, ``*:tool_desc_compaction``)
  rewrites the tool array in place, so both endpoints are countable. Handlers
  fold the delta into ``original_tokens``/``optimized_tokens``, which keeps
  ``tok_before - tok_after == tok_saved`` coherent in the PERF line. It is
  therefore ALREADY inside ``tokens_saved`` and must never be added again.
* **Deferral / hook shrink** (tool search, turn hooks) removes schemas that
  ``count_messages`` never saw, so it cannot move ``original_tokens``. It is
  recorded in per-request tags and is ADDITIVE to ``tokens_saved``.

The one rule a caller needs: the headline is
``tokens_saved + tool_schema_saved_from_tags(tags)``. Use
:func:`headline_tokens_saved` rather than open-coding it — three surfaces had
drifted inline copies of that sum, and two harnesses were silently dropping
their compaction savings entirely because the convention was never written down.

Adding a new tool-schema-shrinking feature? If it moves the tool array, fold it
in the handler like the compaction sites do. If it defers schemas, add its tag
name to :data:`TOOL_SCHEMA_SAVINGS_TAGS` and every surface picks it up.
