"""Remote Kompress: offload ML compression to a hosted ``/compress`` endpoint.

Lets a sandboxed proxy — installed WITHOUT the ``[ml]`` extra (no torch/onnx) —
still run Kompress by calling a remote endpoint over HTTP. The class mirrors
:class:`~headroom.transforms.kompress_compressor.KompressCompressor`'s public
surface (``is_ready`` / ``preload`` / ``ensure_background_load`` / ``compress``),
so it is a drop-in at the ContentRouter seam.

Only the model inference is remote. The CCR store + retrieval marker stay
proxy-local (the endpoint is stateless, ``enable_ccr=False``), so
``headroom_retrieve`` keeps working and original content never persists off-box.

Enabled by ``HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT`` — see ``ContentRouter._get_kompress``.

# Bring-your-own deployment

The endpoint does not have to be Headroom Labs'. An org can pull the Kompress
weights from HuggingFace, serve them on its own stack (vLLM, TorchServe,
SageMaker, KServe, a bare FastAPI box) and point Headroom at it. Nothing about
this class is Modal-specific, and no credential is required — auth is whatever
the operator's own infrastructure expects, including none at all:

    HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT          https://ml.internal.acme.com
    HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT_PATH     /compress   (default; set empty to use
                                        the endpoint URL verbatim)
    HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT_TOKEN    optional; sent as `Authorization: Bearer`
    HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT_HEADERS  optional; `k=v,k2=v2`, applied last so it
                                        can replace the Authorization header for
                                        stacks that want `x-api-key` or similar

Both new knobs default to today's behaviour: with only
``HEADROOM_KOMPRESS_ENDPOINT`` set, the request is byte-identical to before —
``POST <endpoint>/compress`` with an optional Bearer token. Existing Modal
deployments need no change.

# The HTTP contract

Deliberately small, so a shim in front of an existing inference server is a few
lines. ``POST <endpoint><path>``:

    request   {"content": "<text>", "target_ratio": 0.5 | null}
    response  {"compressed": "<text>",          # REQUIRED, must be a string
               "original_tokens": int,          # optional, defaults to word count
               "compressed_tokens": int,        # optional, defaults to word count
               "compression_ratio": float,      # optional, defaults to 1.0
               "model_used": str}               # optional

``compressed`` is the only required field; every other value is derived if
absent. Any non-2xx, timeout, malformed field, or missing ``compressed`` makes
this pass the content through verbatim — a broken endpoint costs compression,
never correctness.
